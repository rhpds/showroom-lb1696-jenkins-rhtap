[id='sigstore']
* *SigStore*: Is an open-source project under the Linux Foundation, backed by organizations like Google, Red Hat, and Chainguard. It aims to revolutionize software supply chain security by providing a standardized approach to signing, verifying, and storing cryptographic evidence throughout the development lifecycle. SigStore offers a suite of tools and services that work together to create a verifiable chain of trust for software artifacts. Here is a quick overview of those tools:
** *Rekor*: A public, tamper-proof transparency log. Rekor acts as a central repository for storing signing information, including timestamps, signing certificates, and cryptographic proofs. This log allows anyone to verify the validity of signatures and the identity of the signer.
** *Fulcio*: A certificate authority (CA) that empowers developers to obtain short-lived certificates for keyless signing. This eliminates the need for complex GPG key management, simplifying the signing process.
** *Cosign*: A command-line tool for signing and verifying software artifacts like container images and blobs.
** *GitSign*: A tool that facilitates keyless signing of Git commits using developer identities from OIDC providers like GitHub or Google.

[id='tektonchains']
* *Tekton Chains*: Is a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) controller designed to manage security within the Tekton continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) framework. It plays a crucial role in securing the software supply chain by focusing on provenance, which refers to the detailed record of an artifact's creation and history. *Tekton Chains* offers some powerful capabilities: 
** *Signing and Attestation*: Allows users to configure signing of the captured provenance with cryptographic keys. This signature acts as a digital seal, guaranteeing the authenticity and integrity of the provenance data. 
** *Provenance Capture*: Observes executions (TaskRuns and PipelineRuns) within your Tekton environment. When a run is complete, Tekton Chains takes a snapshot of the execution details, capturing information about the build process, used resources, and configuration.
** *Provenance Transformation*: Converts the captured snapshot into one or more standardized payload formats, such as in-toto or SLSA (Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts). These formats provide a structured and machine-readable representation of the provenance data.
