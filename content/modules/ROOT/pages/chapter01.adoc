=== Running your first Golden Path Template (GPT)

* Eager as you are, you immediately want to explore the link:glossary.html#gpt[Golden Path Templates (GPT),window=_blank] you've heard so much about from your colleagues.
* You find and click the *Create* link in the left menu.

image::5_Click_Create.png[]

* Among the options, you spot the *GPT* titled *Insecured Quarkus Service Software Supply Chain*
* Feeling a mix of excitement and curiosity, you click the *Choose* button.

NOTE: This lab has been pre-configured with two Golden Path Templates (GPTs), a non-secure GPT and a secure GPT. However, lets pretend that our developer only sees the insecure GPT at this point and the naming of the GPT does not hint at the forthcoming challenges associated with running an insecure software supply pipeline.

image::6_Choose_Insecure_GPT.png[]

* As the form for the *Golden Path Template (GPT)* appears, you're pleasantly surprised.
* Unlike other complicated ticketing systems you've used before, this form is refreshingly simple and seems tailor-made for your particular task.
* "Ah, so my team has opted to use link:glossary.html#quarkus[*Quarkus*,window=_blank] for this project. That's a great framework for developing Kubernetes-native applications," you tell yourself, with excitement sparking within you..
* You click *Next*.

image::7_First_Step_Form.png[]

* You're pleased to find all the input fields are already pre-populated for you.
* You also note that your organization is using link:glossary.html#quay[*Red Hat Quay*,window=_blank] as the image registry.
* You click *Next* on the this form as well.

image::7_Second_Step_Form.png[]

* Now, you hit the *Review* button for a final look at the form inputs.

image::9_Click_Review_Form.png[]

* Everything checks out, so you confidently click on the *Create* button.

image::10_Review_Form.png[]

* The *Golden Path Template (GPT)* kicks into action, and in just a few seconds it sets up everything you need for your *Quarkus* application.
* The *GPT* has done quiet a bit of heavy lifting on your behalf here:
.. It created two repositories in *Gitlab*: one for the application source code and the other for link:glossary.html#gitops[*OpenShift GitOps*,window=_blank] manifests.
.. It instructed *OpenShift GitOps* to create an application and all the specified resources in the manifests in the target link:glossary.html#ocp[*OpenShift*,window=_blank] cluster.
.. *OpenShift GitOps* then processed the link:glossary.html#helm[*Helm Charts*,window=_blank] in the manifests git repo to deploy a CI pipeline in link:glossary.html#pipeline[*OpenShift Pipelines*,window=_blank] to build your application and push it to *Red Hat Quay*.

NOTE: You might be wondering, what if my organization uses tools other than OpenShift GitOps? What if you've invested in Azure DevOps, for example? The great news is that every step in a Golden Path Template is fully customizable, and we can swap out any tool used in a step with one of your choice. This flexibility is made possible through an extensible ecosystem of link:glossary.html#rhdh_plugins[*plugins*,window=_blank]. These plugins enable you to select your preferred tools from the existing plugins marketplace or even develop your custom plugins. So, in a nutshell, a GPT adapts to your organization's workflow, not the other way around.

image::73_GPT_Flow.png[]

* You click on the *Open Component in Catalog* link.

image::11_Executed_GPT.png[]

* And just like that, you're directed to your *Dashboard*, where all the tools you need to start coding are readily available at your fingertips.

image::12_Dashboard.png[]

* The first thing you decide to do is dive into coding on your project.
* You decide to use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), *OpenShift Dev Spaces*, that Developer Hub has been configured to use.  You find and click on the *OpenShift Dev Spaces (VSCode)* link conveniently located in your Dashboard.

NOTE: link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[*OpenShift Dev Spaces*,window=_blank] is a Kubernetes native workspace and IDE that is part of the OpenShift platform. This tool allows your platform team to offer a full fledged IDE that requires zero configuration and effort by your app developers.

image::13_Click_OpenShift_DevSpaces.png[]

* You log in using your OpenShift credentials by clicking the *Log in with OpenShift* button.

image::14_Login_With_OpenShift.png[]

* Then, you choose the Single Sign-On option by clicking the *rhsso* button

image::15_Login_RHSSO.png[]

* You then enter your username and password as follows:
** *Username*: {developer_cluster_rhdh_user}
** *Password*: {developer_cluster_rhdh_user_password}
* After inputting your credentials, you click the *Sign in* button.

* You authorize *OpenShift Dev Spaces* to access your account by clicking the *Allow selected permissions* button.

image::16_Allow_Selected_Permissions.png[]

* *OpenShift Dev Spaces* then begins creating your workspace, processing a *Devfile* containing all the configuration needed to set up your development environment.

NOTE: A link:https://devfile.io/[*Devfile*,window=_blank] is a YAML configuration file that serves as a portable definition for a development environment. It is designed to be a universal format that can describe any type of development environment, making it easier for developers to code, build, test, and run applications across different tools and platforms without the need to manually configure each environment.

image::18_DevSpaces_Process_Devfile.png[]

* A prompt *Do you trust the authors of this repository?* will appear.  Select *Do not ask me again for other repositories* and then click *Continue*

image::99_Devspaces_Trust_Repository.png[]

* Subsequently, you click *Authorize devspaces* to grant *OpenShift Dev Spaces* access to your *GitLab* account.

image::17_Authorize_Gitlab.png[]

* After waiting a few minutes for *OpenShift Dev Spaces* to finish setting up your workspace, you're presented with a fully fledged IDE accessible from your browser.
* You click the button *Yes, I trust the authors*.

image::19_Trust_Authors.png[]

* To accomplish your task, you need to:

. Update the hello method in the ExampleResource.java class.
. Update the JUnit test verifying this method's output.
. Amend the documentation to reflect your changes.

NOTE: The JUnit test for the Hello method needs updating; otherwise, the Build step in the CI/CD pipeline would fail due to discrepancies between the code and its test.

* In your *insecured-app* workspace, you expand the folders *src -> main -> java*, and then open the *ExampleResource.java* file.
* On line 14, you replace the return message of the hello method from "Hello RESTEasy" to "Hello from RHDH".

image::20_Modify_ExampleResource.png[]

* Next, you update the JUnit test for this method.
* You expand the folders *src -> main -> test*, and open the *ExampleResourceTest.java* file.
* On line 18, you change the expected text from "Hello RESTEasy" to "Hello from RHDH".

image::21_Modify_ExampleResourceTest.png[]

* You recall your team's explanation that the documentation coexists with the code, nestled in the same git repository as a markdown file.
* You expand the docs folder and open the markdown file *Index.md*.
* At the document's end, you add: "Release 1.0: Update to ExampleResource.hello() method to return 'Hello from RHDH'."

image::22_Index_File.png[]

* Having completed your task, you're ready to commit your changes.
* You click on the *Source Control* icon located in the left menu.
* Then, you enter the commit message "My First Commit" and click on the *Commit* button to finalize your changes.

image::23_My_First_Commit.png[]

* In the pop-up window that follows, you click *Yes* to stage your changes.

image::24_Stage_Changes.png[]

* Finally, you click on the *Sync Changes* button.

image::25_SYNC_Changes.png[]

* In the pop-up that follows, you click *OK* to push your changes and complete the process.

image::26_OK_To_Push_Changes.png[]

* You've successfully implemented your change and updated the documentation in one commit, following the "docs as code" methodology where documentation is treated with the same level of care and under the same process as source code.
* You are delighted by knowing that following this methodology ensures that your documentation is as current as your code itself.
* Your commit triggers the build pipeline for your *Quarkus* application.
* You switch back to the *RHDH Dashboard* tab in your browser and select the *CI tab* from the top menu.

image::27_Click_on_CI_Tab.png[]

* And just as you expected, a build pipeline has already been triggered.
* You eagerly expand the pipeline view to monitor the progress of this pipeline run.

image::28_Expand_Pipeline_View.png[]

* After a few minutes of anticipation, the pipeline run concludes, and the application image is successfully built.
* You select the *Image Registry* tab from the upper menu and confirm that your image has been pushed to the Registry.

NOTE: This is another plugin in action allowing RHDH to integrate with Red Hat Quay.

image::87_Image_Registry.png[]

* Finally you switch to the *Docs* tab and verify that documentation is up to date.

image::88_Docs_View.png[]

* With a sense of accomplishment, your task now complete, you draft an email to the QA team, inviting them to begin testing your changes.
